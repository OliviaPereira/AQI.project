# # Activity: Explore hypothesis testing

# ## Introduction

# You work for an environmental think tank called Repair Our Air (ROA). ROA is formulating policy recommendations to improve the air quality in America, using the Environmental Protection Agency's Air Quality Index (AQI) to guide their decision making. An AQI value close to 0 signals "little to no" public health concern, while higher values are associated with increased risk to public health. 

# They've tasked you with leveraging AQI data to help them prioritize their strategy for improving air quality in America.

# ROA is considering the following decisions. For each, construct a hypothesis test and an accompanying visualization, using your results of that test to make a recommendation:

# 1. ROA is considering a metropolitan-focused approach. Within California, they want to know if the mean AQI in Los Angeles County is statistically different from the rest of California.
# 2. With limited resources, ROA has to choose between New York and Ohio for their next regional office. Does New York have a lower AQI than Ohio?
# 3. A new policy will affect those states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Will Michigan be affected by this new policy?

# **Notes:**
# 1. For your analysis, you'll default to a 5% level of significance.
# 2. Throughout the lab, for two-sample t-tests, use Welch's t-test (i.e., setting the `equal_var` parameter to `False` in `scipy.stats.ttest_ind()`). This will account for the possibly unequal variances between the two groups in the comparison.

# ## Step 1: Imports
# 
# To proceed with your analysis, import `pandas` and `numpy`. To conduct your hypothesis testing, import `stats` from `scipy`.

# #### Import Packages

# Import relevant packages

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
fom scipy import stats


# You are also provided with a dataset with national Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements by state over time for this analysis. `Pandas` was used to import the file `c4_epa_air_quality.csv` as a dataframe named `aqi`. As shown in this cell, the dataset has been automatically loaded in for you. You do not need to download the .csv file, or provide more code, in order to access the dataset and proceed with this lab. Please continue with this activity by completing the following instructions.

# **Note:** For purposes of your analysis, you can assume this data is randomly sampled from a larger population.

# #### Load Dataset
aqi = pd.read_csv('c4_epa_air_quality.csv')


# ## Step 2: Data Exploration

# ### Before proceeding to your deliverables, explore your datasets.

# Use the following space to surface descriptive statistics about your data. In particular, explore whether you believe the research questions you were given are readily answerable with this data.




# Explore your dataframe `aqi` here:

### YOUR CODE HERE ###

print(aqi.head())

print(aqi.describe(include='all'))

print(aqi.shape())

print(np.mean(aqi))

print(aqi['state_name'].value_counts())



# Any of the following functions may be useful:
# - `pandas`: `describe()`,`value_counts()`,`shape()`, `head()`
# - `numpy`: `unique()`,`mean()`


# #### **Question 1: From the preceding data exploration, what do you recognize?**
# Ohio and New York have the most reported observations of AQI to work with.

# ## Step 3. Statistical Tests

# Before you proceed, recall the following steps for conducting hypothesis testing:
# 
# 1. Formulate the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.<br>
# 2. Set the significance level.<br>
# 3. Determine the appropriate test procedure.<br>
# 4. Compute the p-value.<br>
# 5. Draw your conclusion.

# ### Hypothesis 1: ROA is considering a metropolitan-focused approach. Within California, they want to know if the mean AQI in Los Angeles County is statistically different from the rest of California.

# Before proceeding with your analysis, it will be helpful to subset the data for your comparison.




# Create dataframes for each sample being compared in your test


# For your first dataframe, filter to `county_name` of `Los Angeles`. For your second dataframe, filter to `state_name` of `Calfornia` and `county_name` not equal to `Los Angeles`.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
ca_la = aqi[aqi['county_name']=='Los Angeles']
ca_other = aqi[(aqi['state_name']=='California') & (aqi['county_name']!='Los Angeles')]

print(ca_la)
print(ca_other)



# #### Formulate your hypothesis:

# **Formulate your null and alternative hypotheses:**
# 
# There is no difference in the mean AQI between LA and the rest of California.
# There is a difference in the mean AQI between LA and the rest of California.


# #### Set the significance level:
# For this analysis, the significance level is 5%
### YOUR CODE HERE
significance_level = 0.05
print(significance_level)



# #### Determine the appropriate test procedure:

# Here, you are comparing the sample means between two independent samples. Therefore, you will utilize a **two-sample  ùë°-test**.

# #### Compute the P-value

# Compute your p-value here
#   Be sure to set `equal_var` = False.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
stats.ttest_ind(a=ca_la['aqi'], b=ca_other['aqi'], equal_var=False)


# #### **Question 2. What is your P-value for hypothesis 1, and what does this indicate for your null hypothesis?**

# If the p-value is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.



# ### Hypothesis 2: With limited resources, ROA has to choose between New York and Ohio for their next regional office. Does New York have a lower AQI than Ohio?
# Before proceeding with your analysis, it will be helpful to subset the data for your comparison.


# Create dataframes for each sample being compared in your test

# For your first dataframe, filter to `state_name` of `New York`. For your second dataframe, filter to `state_name` of `Ohio`.

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
ny = aqi[aqi['state_name']=='New York']
ohio = aqi[aqi['state_name']=='Ohio']


# #### Formulate your hypothesis:

# **Formulate your null and alternative hypotheses:**
# 
# The mean AQI of New York is greater than or equal to that of Ohio.
# The mean AQI of Ohio is greater than that of New York.
# 

# #### Significance Level (remains at 5%)

# #### Determine the appropriate test procedure:

# Here, you are comparing the sample means between two independent samples in one direction. Therefore, you will utilize a **two-sample  ùë°-test**.

# #### Compute the P-value
# Compute your p-value here

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
tstat, pvalue = stats.ttest_ind(a=ny['aqi'], b=ohio['aqi'], alternative='less', equal_var=False)
print(tstat)
print(pvalue)



#   In `ttest_ind()`, a is the aqi column from the "New York" dataframe, an b is the aqi column from the "Ohio" dataframe.



#   You can assign `tstat`, `pvalue` to the output of `ttest_ind`. Be sure to include `alternative = less` as part of your code.  


# #### **Question 3. What is your P-value for hypothesis 2, and what does this indicate for your null hypothesis?**
#Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 5% and the t-statistic is <0.


# ###  Hypothesis 3: A new policy will affect those states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Will Michigan be affected by this new policy?

# Before proceeding with your analysis, it will be helpful to subset the data for your comparison.



# Create dataframes for each sample being compared in your test

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
michigan = aqi[aqi['state_name']=='Michigan']
print(michigan)


# #### Formulate your hypothesis:

# **Formulate your null and alternative hypotheses here:**

# The mean AQI of Michigan is less than or equal to 10.
# The mean AQI of Michigan is greater than 10.


# #### Significance Level (remains at 5%)

# #### Determine the appropriate test procedure:

# Here, you are comparing one sample mean relative to a particular value in one direction. Therefore, you will utilize a **one-sample  ùë°-test**. 

# #### Compute the P-value


# Compute your p-value here

### YOUR CODE HERE ###
tstat, pvalue = stats.ttest_1samp(michigan['aqi'], 10, alternative='greater')
print(tstat)
print(pvalue)



#   In `ttest_1samp)`, you are comparing the aqi column from your Michigan data relative to 10, the new policy threshold.

#   You can assign `tstat`, `pvalue` to the output of `ttest_1samp`. Be sure to include `alternative = greater` as part of your code.  


# #### **Question 4. What is your P-value for hypothesis 3, and what does this indicate for your null hypothesis?**

# With a p-value that's greater than 0.05 and a t-statistic < 0, I fail to reject the null hypothesis.

# ## Step 4. Results and Evaluation
# 
# Now that you've completed your statistical tests, you can consider your hypotheses and the results you gathered.

# #### **Question 5. Did your results show that the AQI in Los Angeles County was statistically different from the rest of California?**

# Yes, the results indicated that the AQI in Los Angeles County was different from the rest of California.

# #### **Question 6. Did New York or Ohio have a lower AQI?**

# Using this process, I can see that New York has a lower AQI than Ohio.

# #### **Question 7: Will Michigan be affected by the new policy impacting states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater?**
# My results were unable to conclude the mean being above 10, so it is unlikely Michigan will be affected by the new policy.



# # Conclusion
# 
# **What are key takeaways from this lab?**
# Even with small amounts of data, the differences we see are big enough to confidently draw some conclusions. We found that the air quality in Los Angeles is significantly different from the rest of California, and New York generally has better air quality than Ohio. However, we couldn't say for sure that Michigan's air quality is worse than a certain level.

# **What would you consider presenting to your manager as part of your findings?**
# For each test, I begin by stating what I'm trying to find out and what I believe might be true. Then, based on the data, I decide if my idea is likely correct or not. This decision is influenced by a number called the p-value. I also specify the type of test I'm doing, whether I'm looking at one specific direction or both, and how I analyze the data using statistical methods.

# **What would you convey to external stakeholders?**
# In response to the questions we asked, I'll tell them if the differences we found are significant or not. I'll also share the numbers we used to compare things so they can understand the results better.
