# AQI.project
Google Advanced DA Activity: Explore confidence intervals of Air Quality Indexes.


Real World Activity Details.
Your manager has requested that you do the following for your analysis:
# 1. Provide a summary of the mean AQI for the states in which RRE operates.
# 2. Construct a boxplot visualization for AQI of these states using `seaborn`.
# 3. Evaluate which state(s) may be most affected by this policy, based on the data and your boxplot visualization.
# 4. Construct a confidence interval for the RRE state with the highest mean AQI.


The project contains run through explanations of how the EDA will work, no data is owned by me and access is no longer available.
